## Challenges

1. We managed to get 2 of our members to build and compile successfully! The others still did not succeed but they might need to use the Aalto Virtual Machine in the hopes that it will work without many problems.
2. We have less time and we should start testing prototypes and implementing the libraries as soon as possible

## Actions
1. Start the project
2. Test out the libraries
