## Challenges

1. We're still struggling with various bugs and problems we all encounter while trying to run vscode or implement the libraries.

## Actions
1. Petteri asked some other people who already completed the course for what they did so that we could hopefully learn from them.
2. We'll have a second meeting with our advisor to understand what is the cause of our problems and hopefully how to fix them.
